            Turf-Tec International was started by the late Tom Mascaro in 1976 to manufacture tools that would benefit the Golf Course Superintendents and Sports Turf Managers in their everyday maintenance. Turf-Tec International is now headed by John Mascaro, who joined the company in 1987 and is Tom's son who is carrying on the family tradition of introducing innovative tools to aid the superintendent.  John is also well known for writing the "John Mascaro's Photo Quiz" in Golf Course Management Magazine, which is one of the most respected trade publications in the world of Golf Course Management and the official publication of the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA).  This monthly feature is a photographic question and answer section with photos of common turfgrass problems and their sometimes surprising answers.  The article "John Mascaro's Photo Quiz" also is run in the official publication of the Sports Turf Managers Association of America (STMA) called SportsTurf Magazine.

            With Tom's insight and John's direction, Turf-Tec International has developed a line of diagnostic instruments for turf that until now were only available to researchers at Universities. These instruments are simple to use yet give meaningful results. These diagnostic tools are used to maintain healthy turfgrass, lawns, golf courses and sports fields. We are also developing new technology for the engineering and environmental sector to preserve our most precious resource, water.
